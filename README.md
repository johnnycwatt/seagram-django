# Seagram Properties

Seagram Properties is a fictional real estate website built with Django as a personal learning project to practice web development skills. The company and data (including people and properties) are fictional and do not intend to represent any real company, person, or property. A live demo is available at https://seagram-django.onrender.com.

## Features

- Property Details: Each property has a dedicated detail page showing all relevant information, including a "Contact Us" button that pre-fills a contact form with a message about the specific property.
- Contact Form: Users can submit inquiries with options for subject (for example: buying or selling) and preferred contact method, with validation to ensure required fields are filled.
- Sales Request Form: Allows users to request a market appraisal for selling their property, with similar validation.
- Responsive Design: Uses Bootstrap to ensure the site is mobile-friendly and visually appealing across devices.

## Notes
This is a personal learning project for practicing Django. The company and data (including people and properties) are fictional and do not intend to represent any real company, person, or property. While there is a live demo, this application is not intended to be used for production purposes. The images used in this demo (such as the properties and portraits) were generated using an AI Image-Generation tool called Midjourney.
