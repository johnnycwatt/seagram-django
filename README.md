# Seagram Properties

A fictional real estate website built with Django to practice web development skills.

## Features (Planned)
- Property listings with address, price, status (For Sale and Recently Sold), and photos.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap
- **Database:** SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)

## Current Status
- Models and admin interface for `Property` and `Member` are implemented and tested.
- Templates for "Buy" (property listings), "Sell" (recently sold properties with appraisal request), and "Our People" (team members) are implemented, dynamically displaying data from the `Property` and `Member` models.
- Forms for Contact Inquiries and Sales Requests have been created.
- Next steps: Enhance the templates with additional styling, pagination for the Buy Page, and set up authentication for admin editing.
