        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>In 1825, amidst the rolling hills of Silvermoon Village, Peter Seagram founded Seagram Properties with a vision to help families find their forever homes. What began as a humble endeavor in a quaint village office has grown into a cornerstone of real estate in the lands of Silvermoon Village, Riverwood, and Mystic Town.</p>
            <p>Peter’s passion for community and his unwavering commitment to integrity laid the foundation for a legacy that would span over two centuries. Through wars, economic shifts, and the rise of modern technology, Seagram Properties has remained a steadfast partner to generations of families, helping them navigate the ever-changing landscape of real estate.</p>
            <p>Today, under the leadership of Darian Seagram, Peter’s great-great-great-grandson, we continue to honor our founder’s vision. Darian brings a modern perspective while preserving the values that have defined us for 200 years. From our historic office at 7 Moonshadow Street in Riverwood, we forge connections across communities, ensuring every client finds not just a house, but a home where dreams can flourish.</p>
